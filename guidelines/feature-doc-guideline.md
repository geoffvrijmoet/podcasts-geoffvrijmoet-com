# Project Overview
Use this guide to build a web app that advertises the podcast editing services of Geoff Vrijmoet.

# Feature Requirements
- 
- 
- 
- The web app should have lightning-fast performance.
- The entire app should be extremely mobile-friendly.
- We will use Next.js, Shadcn, Lucid, Clerk, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS to build the app.
- The app should be deployed to Vercel.
- The app should be SEO-friendly.
- The app should be accessible.
- The app should be secure.
- The app should use the github repository: github.com/geoffvrijmoet/podcasts-geoffvrijmoet-com. I would like to be able to push to this repository from Cursor using SSH and the git ui in Cursor.
